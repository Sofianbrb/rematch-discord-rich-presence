# Rematch Discord Rich Presence (Overwolf)

Add **Discord Rich Presence** support for **Rematch** so others can see what you’re doing in-game.

It updates live to show:

- **Lobby status** (waiting for a match)
- **In-match status** (score + winning/losing/drawing)
- A short activity update when a **goal is scored / conceded** (7 seconds)

> Tested on **Windows**.

## Who is this for?

**Everyone** — if you use Discord and play Rematch, this lets Discord display your current Rematch status automatically.

## What it shows

- **In the lobby**: “Waiting for a match…”
- **In a match**: “Winning / Losing / Drawing” + current score
- **Goal moments**: brief update when you score or concede (7 seconds)

---

## Limitations

- **Game mode (Ranked / Quickmatch)** is **not currently supported** due to Overwolf limitations.  
  Overwolf’s documentation marks this data as **currently unavailable**, so the Rich Presence cannot display the active game mode yet.

---

## Notes

- Currently tested on **Windows**
- If Discord doesn’t update:
  - Make sure Discord is running
  - Make sure Discord Activity is enabled
  - Reload the app in Overwolf Developer Tools
